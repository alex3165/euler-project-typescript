# Typescript Euler project

This project is a typescript boilerplate to solve the Euler problems [Project link](https://projecteuler.net)

- Branch master will contain my solutions to the euler problems in typescript
- Branch boilerplate will get the base project and some utils handy to solve the problems

## start

Clone the repository branch boilerplate 

Create your own typescript solution for the euler problems in src folder,
the number of the problem is the name of the file `src/1.ts`

## run

- Install node_modules: `npm i`
- Install `ts-node` globally: `npm i -g ts-node`
- Run: `ts-node src/[problem_number].ts` or `npm run script -- src/[problem_number].ts`

## Good to know

Rebase from the original repository boilerplate branch if you want to get the latest utils,
feel free to add more utils in the original repository if you think that could be usefull for others.
